How do I delete a local branch in Git?
$ git branch -d <local-branch>

How do I delete a remote branch in Git?
$ git push origin --delete <remote-branch-name>

Force deletion of the branch, even if it contains unmerged / unpushed commits
$ git branch -D <local-branch>

Fix committing to the wrong Git branch but not push yet.
$ git reset --soft HEAD^
$ git checkout branch
$ git commit -m "Message"

git undo all uncommitted or unsaved changes
This will unstage all files you might have staged with git add:
$ git reset

This will revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root):
$git checkout .

You can also revert uncommitted changes only to particular file or directory:
$ git checkout [some_dir|file.txt]

Yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes (longer to type, but works from any subdirectory):
$ git reset --hard HEAD
